# Patients-Analytics-Dashboard

🏥 Patients Analytics Project 📊

🔍 Project Overview

This project is a Patients Analytics Dashboard built using Power BI. The goal is to analyze patient data, track key health metrics, and generate insights for better healthcare decision-making. The dashboard visualizes trends, patterns, and correlations within patient records, helping healthcare professionals improve treatment strategies and operational efficiency.

📂 Dataset Information

The dataset includes anonymized patient records with key attributes such as:

🆔 Patient ID

👤 Age

🚻 Gender

🏥 Diagnosis

💊 Treatment History

🏨 Hospital Visits

🧪 Lab Results

💊 Medications

💰 Billing Information


🚧 Key Challenges & Solutions

1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

🛑 Challenge: The dataset contains missing values, inconsistent formatting, and duplicate records.✅ Solution:

🗑️ Used Power Query to remove duplicates.

📊 Handled missing values by imputing mean/median values.

📅 Standardized date formats and categorical values.

2️⃣ Performance Optimization

🛑 Challenge: Large datasets can slow down Power BI reports.✅ Solution:

📉 Used aggregations to reduce data size.

⚡ Optimized DAX measures to improve calculation performance.

🏎️ Used indexing and filtering to enhance query speed.

3️⃣ Data Privacy & Security

🛑 Challenge: Patient data is sensitive and must be handled securely.✅ Solution:

🔒 Applied row-level security (RLS) to restrict data access.

🕵️ Anonymized patient identifiers.

📜 Followed HIPAA/GDPR compliance guidelines.

4️⃣ Dashboard Design & Usability

🛑 Challenge: Making the dashboard user-friendly for non-technical healthcare professionals.✅ Solution:

📊 Used clear and intuitive visualizations (bar charts, line graphs, KPIs).
